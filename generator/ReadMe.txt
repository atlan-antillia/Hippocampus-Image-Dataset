This dataset is provided with the following specifications:

The dataset contains 50 brain T1-weighted MRI volumes with hippocampus labels. 
Images are acquired at two different MRI units (with different field strengths) 
and thus have very different resolutions and contrasts. Twenty of these images 
have a higher resolution and are acquired with a relatively new 3T MRI system.


Forty of these images belong to patients with temporal lobe epilepsy who may 
have atrophic hippocampi. This makes the segmentation challenging and thus 
evaluates the segmentation algorithms against practical problems. The remaining 
10 images belong to nonepileptic subjects.


We have divided the dataset into two groups of training and testing (50% each). 
Training set is provided along with the labels. However, no label is provided for 
the testing set. All images are in ANALYZE format.


Special care has been taken to minimize the effect of partial volume in manual 
drawings. The hippocampi were reconstructed in 3D to ensure that the outlines 
in consecutive slices are consistent.


You are encouraged to first work with the training set. If you are about to make 
a journal publication and would like to report the segmentation results on the 
testing set, you may send a request to Kourosh Jafari-Khouzani. You may then submit 
your segmentation results. We will send you a table of evaluation metrics. Please use 
"Hippocampus Segmentation Dataset" in the subject of your e-mails.
